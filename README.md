# RESTFUL WEB SERVICES

Project Description :- 
The project demonstrates a simple Jersey Application which exposes a web service method to maintain(add,delete,update) network device database, i:e router/switch device details.
These web services use HTTP methods to implement the concept of REST architecture, implementing various functionalities.
The REST Client(POSTMAN) requests for resources while the REST Server(Apache TOMCAT) provides requested services.
Each resource is identified by its URI, Uniform Resource Identifier that enables to locate a resources on the server hosting the web service.
We create RestFul Web Services using Jersey(JAX-RS 2.0), where we define resource classes and methods, using parameter annotations (@path, @GET,@POST, ...@produces etc)
to access user-defined values, and subresources to consume specific resource methods.
